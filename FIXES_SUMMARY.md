# üéâ Fixed Issues Summary

## ‚úÖ **Issue 1: BP Tool Not Using AI - FIXED**

### **Problem:**
- BP tool was still using old mock `analyzeBP` function
- No actual image analysis was happening
- Users got random mock data instead of real AI analysis

### **Solution:**
- Updated `app/tools/bp/page.tsx` to use `imageAnalysisClient.analyzeBP()`
- Now properly calls Gemini AI for image analysis
- Handles async operations with proper error handling

### **What Users Get Now:**
- **Real Image Analysis**: Gemini reads actual BP numbers from photos
- **Smart Detection**: "I couldn't clearly see the BP numbers in your image"
- **Clear Instructions**: "Please upload a clearer photo with better lighting"
- **Accurate Readings**: Actual systolic/diastolic values from the image
